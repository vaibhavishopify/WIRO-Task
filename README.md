Overview
I developed a customized "Featured Collection" section in Shopify using Tailwind CSS and Liquid. The objective was to create a versatile section that can be toggled between a grid and slider view. Additionally, I aimed to provide extensive customization options through the theme editor.
Implementation Details
  
Combined Sections into One with Toggle Functionality:
Initial Requirement: Implement any one section as featured collections with an "Add to Cart" button.
Solution: Developed a unified section with a toggle button to switch between grid and slider views. This allows Merchants to select their preferred layout from the theme editor.

Section Creation:
Created a single section file named featured-collection-custom.liquid.
This file contains all necessary code and functionality, providing various options for customization directly from the theme editor, including title size and title color.

Theme Editor Customization:
Enabled multiple editing options in the theme editor to enhance user control over the section's appearance.
Though some dynamic settings, such as the number of rows in the grid or the number of slides to show in the slider, were not implemented due to the straightforward nature of the section (fixed to display 4 products), these can be added upon request.
Files and Components

Section File:
featured-collection-custom.liquid: Contains the core code for the featured collection section, including grid and slider toggle functionality and theme editor settings.

Snippets:
title-component.liquid: Handles the titles within the sections, allowing customization of size and color. Font family customization can be added if needed (currently only one font is used).
product-card-custom.liquid: A customized product card snippet for the collection, tailored to include only the necessary information, differing from the default product card.
custom-feature-collection-image.liquid: Manages product images within the product card, ensuring optimal display across different screen sizes.
Future Enhancements

Dynamic Settings: Implement additional dynamic settings such as the number of grid rows or slider items, providing more flexibility for the user.
Font Customization: Add options for font family customization in the title-component.liquid snippet.
